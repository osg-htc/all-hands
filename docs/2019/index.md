The traditional **OSG All-Hands Meeting** is incorporated into this joint workshop, while providing extra opportunities
to interact with members of the high-energy physics (HEP) computing community.

**Note:** Due to the joint meeting, the overall schedule of OSG topics is different this year.  For instance, the usual
Monday schedule of US-ATLAS, US-CMS, and FIFE sessions has changed.  Please check the timetable (link below) carefully
for details.
